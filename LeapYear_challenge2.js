ðŸ’ªThis is a Difficult Challenge ðŸ’ª
check if a particular year is a leap year:
A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;
except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;
unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.*/

    2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
    2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
    2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
    so the year 2000 is a leap year.*/
